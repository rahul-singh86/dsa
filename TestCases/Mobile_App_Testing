Mobile application testing is a procedure to test mobile applications for usability, functional, and consistency glitches.

Mobile application testing is very different from software testing and web testing. There are a few specifics that you should consider before performing mobile application testing:

1)Screen resolution
2)Turning on/off GPS
3)Screen orientation (landscape, portrait)
4)Different devices’ manufacturers
5)OSs
6)Type of mobile application

Types of Mobile Application

1)Mobile web applications: These are the web pages that you open through the mobile browser.
2)Native Apps: These are the applications that are developed for one particular platform. (iOS, Android, Windows 10 M0bile, Tizen, BlackBerry).
3)Hybrid: It is an amalgamation of mobile web app and Native App.

TEST STRATEGY
1)Selection of the device
    - Research for the most widely held and used mobile in the market.
    - Look out for the mobile with different screen resolutions.
    - Select the mobile with a different OS.
    - Don’t underestimate features like compatibility, memory size, connectivity, etc. and pay good attention to them.

2)Emulators or Simulators?
    - An emulator is the original device replacement that allows you to run applications on your gadget without being able to modify them.
    - simulator doesn’t imitate mobile’s hardware but can set up the analogous environment as of your original mobile’s OS

3)Cloud-based testing of the mobile application
    - Allowing run mobile devices to run on several systems and networks, cloud-based testing helps to get over the drawbacks of simulators and real devices.

Stages of Mobile application testing

   1)DOCUMENTATION PHASE - Analyzing the Requirments UI/UX for the same
   2)FUNCTIONAL TESTING - need to be done keeping below things in mind :-

    a)Business functionality of your app like banking, social networks, ordering and delivery of food, education, tickets, the game industry, etc.
    b)Target audience like companies, students, entrepreneurs, etc.
    c)Distribution channels like Google Play, direct delivery, App Store, etc.

    The basic validations that you need to test in functional testing are:

    a)Installing and running the application
    b)Fields testing
    c)Business functionalities testing
    d)Interruptions testing
    e)Constant users feedback testing
    f)Update testing
    g)Device resources testing

    3)USABILITY TESTING- ensures that your application offers convenient browsing to your customers and creates an intuitive interface that abides by industry standards

    a)Satisfaction
    b)Efficiency
    c)Effectiveness

    4)UI (User Interface) TESTING

    5)Compatibility (Configuration) testing :-Compatibility (Configuration) testing validates the optimal performance of your application on different devices based on their size, screen resolution, version, hardware, etc. Compatibility testing also takes care of
    it takes care of below configuration :-
    a)OS Configuration
    b)Browser Configuration
    c)Database Configuration
    d)Device Configuration
    e)Network Configuration

    it can be divided onto :-

    1)Cross-platform testing: Testing your mobile application compatibility with different operating systems: Windows, iOS, Android, and BlackBerry, etc.
    2)Cross-browser testing:    Testing your mobile application compatibility in different browsers Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Opera Mini, etc.
    3)Database testing:    Testing your mobile application compatibility in different database configurations: DB2, Oracle, MSSQL Server, MySql, Sybase.
    4)Device Configuration testing:  Testing your mobile application compatibility on different devices based on
      a)Device type: smartphone, tablet, etc.
      b)Device configuration: processor type, RAM, battery capacity, screen resolution, etc.
    5)Network configuration testing:   Testing your mobile application compatibility in different network configurations (TDMA, GSM) and standards (2G, 3G, 4G).

   6)PERFORMANCE TESTING :- helps you test your application reaction and constancy under the specific workload.
       a)Load Testing: It is done to check the application’s behavior under normal and extreme loads.
       b)Stress Testing: It is done to test the application’s ability to sustain stress. It ensures that your application is capable to bear undue stress.
       c)Stability Testing: It tests if your application can work well for a longer period within normal loads.
       d)Volume Testing: It is conducted to test your application’s performance when subjected to a huge volume of data.
       e)Concurrency testing: It tests the performance of your application when multiple users are logged in.

   7)SECURITY TESTING:-Security testing validates the security features of your application. It also analyzes the risks of application hackers, protection, viruses, and unauthorized access to extremely sensitive data.

   8)RECOVERY TESTING:-Recovery testing tests the ability of your application to withstand and successfully recover from possible and potential failures caused by software issues, hardware failures, or communication problems.

   9)LOCALIZATION TESTING:-Localization testing tests the adaptability of your application for a specific target audience based on cultural specifics.

   10)PATCH TESTING:-Related to patch due to bug
    a)ReTesting-After Code/Bug Fix
    b)Regression Testing- Retesting due to some external changes impacting ur change/code

   11)BETA TESTING - Done on Real devices in Prod like Environment to check all E2E Behaviour
    1)A number of testing participants
    2)Testing duration
    3)Shipping
    4)Demographic coverage
    5)Testing costs

    12)CERTIFICATION TESTING :- Done to make sure all the SOW Points are covered as per agreement also
    your application meets the standards, licensing agreements, terms of use and requirements of stores like the App Store, Google Play, and Windows Phone.


    CHALLENGES :- Challenges of mobile application testing
    1)Testing approach based on device
    2)Availability of multiple mobile user interfaces
    3)Greater security issues.
    4)Time constraint to market app
    5)Constantly changing environment and usage pattern of mobile phones
    6)Testing of touch screens is more complicated.
    7)User Experience & Issues with App Performance
