Use Two Devices to Test Document Conflicts : set up two devices to be connected to a single iCloud account
__________________________________________

TESTCASE 1 : To test document version conflicts with one device offline

 On device 1, create and open a new document using your app, and then open the document on device 2.

 The document is now open on both devices.

 On device 1, turn on airplane mode and then edit the document.

 On device 2 (which is still online), edit the document as well.

 On device 1, turn off airplane mode.

 On each device, check whether the conflict resolution behavior is as you intend it to be.

 TESTCASE 2: To test document version conflicts with two devices offline

 On device 1, create and open a new document using your app, then open the document on device 2.

 The document is now open on both devices.

 Turn on airplane mode on both devices, then edit the document on both devices.

 Try varying this procedure by finishing your changes on the two devices at the same time or at different times.

 On both devices, turn off airplane mode.

 For this step as well, try varying this procedure by turning off airplane mode at the same time or at different times for the two devices.

 On each device, check whether the conflict resolution behavior is as you intend it to be.

 TESTCASE 3 :To test forward and backward compatibility of your document format

 Install the oldest supported version of your app on device 1; install the newest version on device 2.

 Create a document on each device. Allow enough time to elapse so that each doc appears on the other device.

 Open each document on the device that was not used to create it. Or, in the case of a version mismatch in which you do not support opening, ensure that the behavior is as you intend it to be. Check for issues.

 TESTCASE 4 :To test document management

 Save a document to iCloud, then open that document on two devices.

 Using device 1, rename (or, alternatively, delete) the document.

 Check on device 2 whether the behavior is as you intend it to be.
